A rationale for your choice of primary/backup protocol, if you implement a protocol 
that is different from the ones we discussed in class. If the protocol is not one we 
discussed in class then include a description (at most 2 pages) and a pointer to a 
publication (paper or textbook) where this protocol is discussed.

A description (at most 2 pages) of the recovery protocol that was implemented along 
with an informal correctness argument (at the level that might be presented during a 
lecture in cs5414). Give a pointer to a publication (paper or textbook) if your protocol 
is derived from that prior work.

Replication protocol:
As discussed in class, we used primary-backup for our replication protocol. 

Recovery protocol:
After the user notifies the oracle that a replica has recovered, the oracle broadcasts
this fact to all servers and clients so they can update their state accordingly. When the newly 
recovered replica receives this message, it contacts its current primary, who sends it all
data stored, transactions in progress, and current states of all replicas. The replica is now
up-to-date. If it should be the head, it will take over the duties of the head when the client
starts sending transactions to it.
