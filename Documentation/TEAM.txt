Ben first made a completely new Messaging.java class. The old class had become irreparably
complex and bug-ridden. Ben then integrated the old server and java files with the new messaging
class and fixed all errors from the project 3 submission. Ben wrote the JVM class and integrated
the client and server with the failure detection service. He spent 35 hours on this project.
