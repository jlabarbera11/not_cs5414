We used junit to test our implementation, which we have included in our
submission.

ClientTest.java was used to test the basic funcationality of the system
(deposit, withdraw, etc). TestBackupFailures was used to ensure that 
the system remains functional when backups fail. TestPrimaryFailures was
used to ensure that the system remains functional when the primary fails.

The test cases can be found in client.test and messaging.test. Tests were
run using Eclipse on a Windows 7 machine. The tests may not work properly
in other settings (i.e. other operating systems).
