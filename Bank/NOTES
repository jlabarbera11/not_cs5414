Messaging:
    Required to start everything before a transaction can go through
        This is because the server waits to make all connections before
        listening to connections.
    
    Only responsd to messages from the client, not from other servers
        This was to stay as close to the unidirectional link as possible.
        It's a little weird, we should ask if it's ok.

    A server should now be able to send a transfer to itself. We can remove the
    check on the server level.
